"In this work, generative artificial intelligence tools, namely Edge's Copilot and Google Gemini, were used to summarize articles and chapters and search for references. These tools were employed under the author's supervision, and all generated content was verified for accuracy. The authorship and validation of the content remain entirely the responsibility of the author, and the use of artificial intelligence complies with institutional standards of academic integrity."
